// Create logical expressions
LogicExpression logicExpr = new LogicExpression("A B AND NOT");

// Create mathematical expressions
MathExpression mathExpr = new MathExpression("A B + C *");

// Initialize nodes with expressions
Node logicNode = new CustomLogicNode("LogicNode1", logicExpr, 1, 2, 1, 2);
Node mathNode = new CustomMathNode("MathNode1", mathExpr, 1, 2, 1, 2);

// Connect nodes
logicNode.connect(mathNode);

// Serialize to JSON
JSONObject workflowJson = logicNode.toJSON();
System.out.println(workflowJson.toString(4));
```

*Note: `CustomLogicNode` and `CustomMathNode` are hypothetical implementations extending the abstract `Node` class tailored for specific expression types.*

## **üß© Detailed Components**

### **1. `Node` Abstract Class**

#### **Package:**
`com.lazicode.workflow.node`

#### **Overview:**
The `Node` class serves as the foundational building block of the workflow system. It represents individual units within a workflow that can be interconnected to define the workflow's execution path. Each `Node` can perform operations based on expressions and manage its connections with other nodes.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`: Identifier for the node.
  - `connections`: A `Set<Node>` maintaining connections to other nodes.
  - `expression`: An `Expression` object defining the node's operation.
  - `maxInput`, `maxOutput`, `minInput`, `minOutput`: Constraints on the number of allowable input and output connections.
  - `creationTime`: Timestamp of node creation in UTC.

- **Constructors:**
  - **Default Constructor:** Initializes a node with a name and default connection limits.
  - **Parameterized Constructor:** Allows setting an expression and custom connection limits. It validates the provided expression to ensure it's valid before initialization.

- **Interfaces Implemented:**
  - `InputAble`: Manages input connections.
  - `OutputAble`: Manages output connections.
  - `JSONPersistable`: Facilitates JSON serialization for persistence or data transfer.

- **Expression Integration:** Each node can encapsulate an `Expression`, allowing it to perform specific operations (logical or mathematical) during workflow execution.

- **JSON Serialization:** Implementing `JSONPersistable` ensures that nodes can be easily serialized and deserialized, facilitating storage and transmission.

### **2. Expression Evaluation Classes**

Expressions are central to defining the operations that each node performs. The framework abstracts expressions to support both logical and mathematical computations.

#### **2.1. `Expression` Abstract Class**

##### **Package:**
`com.lazicode.workflow.expressions`
